# Stage 0 : Starting from Zero

Stage0 is informational-only, there are no lab instructions to follow.

During this stage you should get aquatinted with the lab workspace and your lab group.

## Lab workspace:

The NTT-LAB starts with two objects in the lab workspace: the WAN-CLOUD and WAN-SWITCH.

Note: Do NOT delete or modify the WAN-SWITCH or WAN-CLOUD.

## Lab scenario:

Your lab group works for a small MSP.

Your instructor is your senior engineer.

The MSP you work for has been hired to build a small business environment.

The client has requested the following:

 - a secure network
 - an internal Windows Domain
 - an internal Microsoft IIS webserver
 - an internal Windows 10 workstation
 - a public webserver
 - a public FTP server
 - a LAN network on 10.128.0.0/24
 - a DMZ network on 10.128.10.0/24
 - a GUEST network on 10.128.99.0/24

This is your first big project, and your senior engineer has provided instructions to follow for the build out. If you get stuck or need help, you can reach out to your senior engineer, but doublecheck the instructions and troubleshoot first.

When you reach out to a senior engineer for help, you should always provide as much info as you can up front.
